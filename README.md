# attack-analysis-on-network
The project aims to use machine learning and its different types of techniques to perform network attack analysis and a comparative study of these algorithms. For this project, weâ€™ll be using a Classification Technique based on Machine Learning.
Section 1, uses the dataset of possible attacks over a network to analyse the dominating attacks and factors.
Section 2, The machine learning algorithms are used for detecting the attack. Section3, Comparative analysis of all the algorithms used has been done.
Classification is a supervised machine learning approach in which the computer program learns from the provided input and then uses that data to classify the information in a different form.
Classification is sorting the given data into a number of different classes. It can be performed on both structured as well as unstructured data.
